### Frontend
#### Booststrap v3.3
PDF Maker Pro uses a custom, themed Bootstrap 3 distribution from [http://bootswatch.com](http://bootswatch.com). The theme's name is [Paper](http://bootswatch.com/paper/). It is based on [Google](http://www.google.com/design/)'s new [design language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_language) called ["Material"](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html)

#### Semantic HTML5 & CSS3
The frontend is built with best practices in mind and aims to hold semantic HTML and CSS.

##### CSS
###### SASS
We are using SASS (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) to generate our CSS. Sass is a programmatic way to write CSS, and compiles in your project to the folder of your choosing. You can find out more about SASS here: (http://sass-lang.com)[http://sass-lang.com/].

#### JavaScript
###### Coffeescript
Our frontend interface is heavily reliant on JavaScript. Coffeescript does a good job of keeping things simple, compared to the somewhat verbose nature of JavaScript.
###### Grunt - JavaScript Task Runner
It's possible Grunt may help improve fronend workflow. It might be used at a later time.

## Workflow Tools
### Git & GitHub
We are using (Git)[http://git-scm.com/] for source control management, and (GitHub)[https://github.com/] for collaboration and project management (issue tracker always comes in handy and acts as a great to-do list).
